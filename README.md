# Unity3D_Apartment_Tour

-This is a personal project that I worked on my internship.

-Aim of the project is to improve and demonstrate my 3D modeling skills and create a vr like house walking simulation.

-The assets and models are all made by me using Blender. 

-The door, closet and drawer grabbing mechanics are all made using VR techniques.

-You can move with W A S D keys and interract with objects using Left Mouse Button.

-You can download the playable build from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Aw0HWx4HupxjlxLvTjUQnUB9aC9DbUsH?usp=sharing
